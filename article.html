							<p>According to World Health Organization (WHO), cervical cancer is one of the most serious threats to
								women’s lives. By various estimates, there are more than a million women suffering from this malignant
								disease worldwide. In 2020 alone, cervical cancer took the lives of more than 342,000 women.</p>
							<p>In 2020, WHO approved the Global Strategy for cervical cancer elimination. The main goals of the
								program, called “90-70-90”, will completely save humanity from the problem of cervical cancer within the
								next 100 years. This is a 90% vaccination rate of the human papillomavirus (HPV) for girls under the age
								of 15 (before the sexual activity begins); accessibility for at least 70% of women of reproductive age
								to highly effective methods of screening (diagnosis) of cervical cancer and, finally, providing
								treatment for at least 90% of women diagnosed with cervical disease. [1]</p>
							<p>The main aim that we set ourselves when writing this article is to once again remind the available and
								recommended methods for screening cervical pathology, and share our best practices in this direction.
							</p>
							<h2>The Problem</h2>
							<P>The generally recognized types of cervical screening, i.e., methods for the primary diagnosis of
								cervical pathology are visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA); cytology (PAP smear test), and HPV
								testing. Moreover, in all cases where a cervical pathology is detected during a screening study, a
								confirmation of the clinical diagnosis by colposcopic examination and/or taking a targeted cervical
								biopsy is required. That is why, in achieving the targets set by WHO, the solution of two main tasks at
								the national and global levels is of key importance. Firstly, this is a solution to the problem of
								accessibility of wide female population groups to effective methods for diagnosing cervical pathology.
								Secondly, the professional training level of specialists conducting relevant examinations.</P>
							<p>From our point of view, the problems that women in the target group have with the opportunity to gain
								access to cervical screening are primarily due to the fact that the vast majority of women with cervical
								cancer, according to the WHO statistics, lived (and live now!) in low- and middle-income countries. So
								about 90% of the total number of cases of cervical cancer are registered in the countries of Central and
								South America, East Africa, South, and Southeast Asia, and the Western Pacific. [2]</p>
							<p>The second most difficult problem to implement is the maximum objectification of the chosen diagnostic
								method.</p>
							<p>In this regard, in the area of our interest lies the objectification of a visual method for diagnosing
								cervix pathology, such as a colposcopic examination. We agree with the thesis that during the period of
								maximum objectification of the processed data, colposcopy is a dying art but it remains an integral part
								of measures to prevent cervical cancer from ever developing. So, in the United States, colposcopy
								continues to be widely used in various medical settings, including academic and non-academic
								institutions, primary health care settings in urban and rural areas, and by the way, continues to be
								funded by both private and public resources [3]. The study itself is usually examined by experienced
								specialists (65% physicians, 36% advanced practice clinicians (APC), i.e., nurse practitioners and
								paramedics). [4]</p>
							<p>Nevertheless, colposcopy is a rather subjective diagnostic method that requires training and constant
								practice of using the method to obtain the appropriate competencies. Thus, according to the scientific
								literature, the frequency of false-negative results (missed squamous intraepithelial / high-grade
								malignancy invasive cancer) during colposcopy ranges from 13% to 69%. [5, 6]</p>
							<p>That is why attempts are being made to improve the diagnostic properties of colposcopy by developing
								new additional technologies that use the biochemical and morphological changes present in dysplastic
								(atypical) cells of the cervix.</p>
							<p>There are three main areas of modern developments: fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy, dynamic
								spectral imaging, and optical coherence tomography. In spite of that, it is worth emphasizing that only
								one of them, namely dynamic spectral imaging, has received FDA approval and is sold in the United
								States.</p>
							<h2>Our Solution</h2>
							<p>Having analyzed the abovementioned information, we have focused our efforts specifically on the
								development of an effective and available screening methodology that will help women who do not have the
								opportunity to undergo face-to-face screening in a medical institution, for example, women living in
								remote and/or areas that are difficult to access for modern medical technologies.</p>
							<p>Our proposed method of primary/intermediate screening of cervical pathology can be represented by the
								following scheme:</p>
							<p>patient -> device that allows a woman to take a picture of the cervix without outside help -> Internet
								access -> website/application -> double assessment of the resulting image: a medical expert and our
								artificial intelligence algorithm -> personal recommendation for the patient.</p>
							<p>At this stage, we can already offer a prototype of our device, which has passed the experimental
								research stage and showed impressive results. Intravaginal system “Lily” with a working camera and
								backlight.</p>
							<figure>

							</figure>
							<p>The machine learning model developed by our team is called “Dr. Gynecom”. It is trained with the Keras
								framework and TensorFlow backend. According to the scientific requirements, a model with two outputs was
								chosen – for segmentation and classification of the input image. The U-Net architecture was taken as a
								basis, where the decoder is a common part for both outputs.</p>
							<p>Segmentation detects the location of pathologies, and classification indicates the accuracy of the
								presence of a particular pathology shown in the processed image. Thus, the application draws the
								doctor’s attention to problematic areas of the cervix with the result of two separate branches of the
								model algorithm, while the patient is able to receive a personally verified conclusion and a
								recommendation. The model was trained on the basis of 1500 colposcopic images marked by a high-category
								practice doctor. Various augmentation algorithms were used to increase the dataset. As a result, the
								accuracy of the trained data for segmentation exceeds 90.5% and 96.5% – for classification.</p>
